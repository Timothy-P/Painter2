# Painter2
This is a quick one-and-done thing I put together. A lot of people who I sent the original to (https://github.com/Timothy-P/Paint.github.io), but some found that they wanted to hold the button down and create multiple colors without clicking constantly.

Another small part of it is that it doesn't require jQuery. It just makes it easier and a bit better for when you don't have internet and the Google Chrome dino game isn't doing it for you.
