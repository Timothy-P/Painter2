# Painter2
This is a quick one-and-done thing I put together. A lot of people who I sent the original to (https://github.com/Timothy-P/Paint.github.io), but some found that they wanted to hold the button down and create multiple colors without clicking constantly.

Another small part of it is that it doesn't require jQuery. It just makes it easier and a bit better for when you don't have internet and the Google Chrome dino game isn't doing it for you.

#How To Use
I don't have it deployed yet, so you'll just have to acquire it the old-fashioned way.

Visit my README.md on my profile or click [this link](https://github.com/Timothy-P/Timothy-P#html-projects).

If needed, I can clarify more. Make an issue [here](https://github.com/Timothy-P/Timothy-P/issues). Then, describe what you need. Please use as much detail as you can manage.
